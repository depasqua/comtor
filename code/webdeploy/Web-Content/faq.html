					<h5>Who sponsors COMTOR?</h5>
						<p>COMTOR's development has been funded by The College of New Jersey's (TCNJ)
						Information Technology mini grants program, the 
						<a href="http://cra-w.org/ArticleDetails/tabid/77/ArticleID/51/Collaborative-Research-Experience-for-Undergraduates-CREU.aspx">
						CRA's CREU</a> program, and the <a href="http://nsf.gov/">
						National Science Foundation</a>.</p>
						
					<h5>Where is COMTOR running?</h5>
						<p>Our system for local research experimentation is hosted on the TCNJ campus.
						This cloud-based version is running on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">
						Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
						
					<h5>What information do you collect?</h5>
						<p>When you use the COMTOR system (this cloud-based interface), we store:
							<ul class="disc">
							<li>your email address - so that we may later determine how many times you possibly
							used our system</li>
							<li>the date and time of your upload - so that we may later determine how
							frequently you used our system</li>
							<li>your IP address - so that we may later determine where in the world you
							used our system</li>
							<li>the URL of your report - so that we can debug your reports, if needed
							analyze the system responsiveness, and anonymously aggregate our analysis</li>
							</ul>
						We do not store your source code. Don't believe us? You can see exactly 
						<a href="http://comtor.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=comtor/comtor;a=blob;f=code/src/org/comtor/cloud/AWSServices.java;hb=HEAD">
						where we execute the call</a> to the Amazon SDB service to store our reports and
						what we store. Really. Look for the method named <tt>storeCloudUse</tt>.
						</p>
						
					<h5>Will you sell the data you collect?</h5>
						<p>No.</p>
						
					<h5>Will you release the data you collect?</h5>
						<p>We will only release the anonymized, aggregated usage statistics in our
						research papers and to reports to our sponsors, like the National Science
						Foundation.</p>
