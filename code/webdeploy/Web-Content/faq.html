		<span class="section">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</span>
		<dl class="faqList">
			<dt>Who is COMTOR for?</dt>
				<dd>COMTOR is provided as a free service in the hopes that it will benefit the
					educational community. COMTOR is provided for non-commercial use. If your
					requirements are beyond our intended use cases, please contact us regarding your
					interests. The COMTOR service is monitored for its use and if necessary we will
					curtail non-educational access and initiate a usage discussion.</dd>
		
			<dt>Who sponsors COMTOR?</dt>
				<dd>COMTOR's development has been funded by The College of New Jersey's (TCNJ)
				Information Technology mini grants program, the 
				<a href="http://cra-w.org/ArticleDetails/tabid/77/ArticleID/51/Collaborative-Research-Experience-for-Undergraduates-CREU.aspx">
				CRA's CREU</a> program, and the <a href="http://nsf.gov/">
				National Science Foundation</a>.</dd>
				
			<dt>Where is COMTOR running?</dt>
				<dd>Our system for local research experimentation is housed on the TCNJ campus.
				This cloud-based version is running on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">
				Amazon Web Services</a>.</dd>
				
			<dt>What information do you collect?</dt>
				<dd>When you use the COMTOR system (this cloud-based interface), we store:
					<ul>
					<li>your email address - so that we may later determine how many times you possibly
					used our system</li>
					<li>the date and time of your upload - so that we may later determine how
					frequently you used our system</li>
					<li>your IP address - so that we may later determine where in the world you
					used our system</li>
					<li>the URL of your report - so that we can debug your reports, if needed
					analyze the system responsiveness, and anonymously aggregate our analysis</li>
					</ul>
				We do not store your source code. Don't believe us? You can see exactly 
				<a href="http://comtor.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=comtor/comtor;a=blob;f=code/src/org/comtor/cloud/AWSServices.java;hb=HEAD">
				where we execute the call</a> to the Amazon SDB service to store our reports and
				what we store. Really. Look for the method named <tt>storeCloudUse</tt>.
				</dd>
				
			<dt>Will you sell the data you collect?</dt>
				<dd>No.</dd>
				
			<dt>Will you release the data you collect?</dt>
				<dd>We will only release the anonymized, aggregated usage statistics in our
				research papers and to reports to our sponsors, like the National Science
				Foundation.</dd>
				
			<dt>Where can I find more information about this project?</dt>
				<dd>The formal home for the COMTOR project can be found at <a href="http://www.comtor.org">
				www.comtor.org</a>.</dd>
				
			<dt>I have questions. Whom should I email?</dt>
				<dd>You can reach the COMTOR Principal Investigator (PI) Pete DePasquale at 
				<a href="mailto:comtor@tcnj.edu">comtor@tcnj.edu</a>.</dd>

			<dt>Who else is working on COMTOR?</dt>
				<dd>There are four principals involved in the project at this time: Pete DePasquale,
				Dr. Miroslav Martinovic (CO-PI, Computer Science, TCNJ), Dr. Michael Locasto 
				(consultant, Computer Science Department, University of Calgary), and Dr. Lisa
				Kaczmarczyk (Independent Assessment Consultant). A bevy of TCNJ students have
				additionally contributed to the overall COMTOR project.</dd>
				
			<dt>This is cool. What else are you up to?</dt>
				<dd>We have plans for additional tools and capabilities. While we do talk
				about some of our direction on our <a href="http://www.comtor.org">main web site 
				and wiki</a>, we are not yet ready to announce anything else at this time.</dd>
				
			<dt>I would like to get involved. How can I do so?</dt>
				<dd>Our faculty community is centering around our <a href="http://gplus.comtor.org">
				Google Plus presence</a>. Developers can get involved by talking with the PI (see
				above) and/or visiting our <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/comtor">
