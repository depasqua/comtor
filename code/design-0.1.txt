===========================================================================

The core design is a pipeline that invokes different feature measurement
tools on a particular Collection of Classes.

Each stage of the pipeline produces a CommentQualityRecord. This object
defines the information about the feature that was measured.

The pipeline is designed to be invoked via a cmd-line driver or via a
JSP/servlet.

The CommentQualityRecord class hierarchy is designed to allow flexible data
recording, from standard output to JSP to a database backend.

The second phase of design should introduce some rational agent/expert system
that follows rules for correlating across reports.
