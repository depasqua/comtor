[Summary]

This document describes a structured means of specifying source code
comments. The main task of this file is to document the grammar for
comments. The grammar is encapsulated by comment language delimiters
(such as /* and */ for C, Java, C++). Therefore, the grammar is only
concerned with what happens between these delimiters. There are
situations where the parser may need to look outside the text of the
comment (this is the job of the comment linker) for references to
local or global data members and variables, for example. Thus, a
comment language is a hybrid of two languages: a language for
specifying comments, and the source code language the comment 
specification is embedded in.

The compiled form of a comment is called a skit. A skit can be an
executable program, a score or rating of the comment's quality, or
a policy that is interpreted in parallel with the source code's
machine representation.

[Grammar]

A Skit is formed by all the comments in the source. These comments
may be intertwined with source code, so we need to embed entities
that represent such code.

A Comment ends with .$EOC
