--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[TASKS]

 * develop the base feature tool set
 * develop the "controlflow" tag
 * run experiments on student and open-source codebases
 * manual inspection to get an "expert" opinion on how good a code
    base is, compare with what the basic features say (or don't say).
 * publish code
 * write paper
 * stand up small web server (one file at a time, provided by URL).

[ISSUES]
 
 * deal with unevenly documented codebases
 * come up with JAR submission format or other (maybe an XML document at
   a URL that describes how to obtain the source of the student/prof/dev's
   application?)
