Basic Comment Mentor Installation
=================================

[Summary]

This file contains both installation and removal instructions for COMTOR.

Comment Mentor uses a web application that requires some web server setup.

[Web Application]

 1) Unpack comtorX.X.X.tar.gz (if you are reading this file, you probably did so)
 2) Visit the install directory in your browser and follow the on-screen instructions.
 
 NOTE: Beyond all the work performed by the web installer, you will be required to
    do two steps outside of the web interface. Please remember to do these as you
    are prompted by the web installer.
