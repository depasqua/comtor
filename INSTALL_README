Basic Comment Mentor Installation
=================================

The following steps for installing COMTOR on your system apply to versions
1.5 and later.

To install COMTOR, please do the following:

1.	First, you will have to instantiate a new database for COMTOR. Please
	be sure that you have the user permissions to do this.
	
	After you have created a new database, we will have to edit one of our
	.sql files before we run it on our new database.
	
	Please naviate to the install/ directory, and find the 'admin.sql' file.
	Within, please edit the following lines as indicated:
	
	XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
	
	Finally, run the following .sql files on that database,
	IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:
	
		scheme.sql
		data.sql
		admin.sql

2. 	Make sure you have the correct software dependencies that COMTOR needs.
	They are the following:
		PHP5
		PEAR Mail
		PEAR Text/Password
		PEAR Net/SMTP
		ANT
		Java Version 1.5 (or later)
		Javac Version 1.5 (or later)
		Javadoc
		jar
		MySQL Connector/J
		ANTLR
		Crontab
		chmod
		mkdir
		mv
		rm
		find
		cat
		grep
		
3.	You will next need set all of the configuration variables for use by COMTOR.
	For your convenience, examples and explanations are listed for each file both
	here and in the individual files, and in some cases, may include dummy values.
	Just simply insert your own values.
	
	/www/config.php
		In this file, you will see this line:
			define("PRIVATE_DIR", "/home/comtor/private/comtor_dev/");
		Please edit the second string within the double quotes to point to
		wherever the /comtor_data/config/config.php file is (we will edit this
		file later).
		
		For example:
			define("PRIVATE_DIR", "/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/config/");
			
	/comtor_data/config/config.php
		In this file, you will edit the following lines accordingly:
			define("MYSQL_HOST", "localhost");
				Please enter in the URL of your database host.
				
			define("MYSQL_USERNAME", "username");
				Please enter the username through which COMTOR
				can access the database.
				
			define("MYSQL_PASSWORD", "password");
				Please enter the password COMTOR should use for
				the username you specified above.
				
			define("MYSQL_DB", "comtordb");
				Please enter the name of the database you created
				in step 1 of this installation process.
				
			define("EMAIL_SMTP_HOST", "smtp.server.com");
				Please define the host of the SMTP server to be
				used for sending out mail from COMTOR.
				
			define("URL_PATH", "www.mywebsite.com/comtor/www/");
				Please define the URL path to the www/ directory
				of COMTOR.
				
			define("UPLOAD_DIR", "/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/uploads/");
				Please define the directory path to the uploads/ directory
				of COMTOR. It will always be in /comtor_data/.
				
			$dir = "/mywebsite/comtor/www/";
				Please define the directory path to the www/ directory
				of COMTOR.
				
		At the end of this file, you will see three other additional variables. Please
		DO NOT change these.
		
	/comtor_data/config/java.properties
		In this file, you will edit the following lines accordingly:
			databaseUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost/comtordb
				Please enter the URL as seen by the java connection to
				the COMTOR database. It will probably look much like what is
				provided for you.
				
				For example:
					jdbc:mysql://URL/path/of/my/database/server/NameOfDatabase

			username = root
				Please enter the name of the username for the database through
				which COMTOR can connect.

			password = password
				Please enter the password for the username specified above.
				
			dictionary = /mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/resources/words
				Please enter the path directory to the words file.
				It will always be in /comtor_data/resources/words.
				You should only need to edit the path before that.
				
		At the end of this file, you will see one other field. You can ignore this entry,
		and leave it as is. It is currently not used.
			
	/www/scripts/config.sh
		In this file, you will need to edit the following lines accordingly:
			UPLOAD_PATH=/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/uploads
				This is the directory path to the uploads directory.
				It should be the same as what you specified above.
				
			CLASSES=/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/code/comtor.jar
				This is the directory path to comtor.jar, which is
				always found in the comtor_data/code/ directory.
				
			CLASSPATH='.:/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/code/stringtemplate-3.2.jar:/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/code/comtor.jar:/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/code/antlr-3.1.1.jar:/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/code/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6-bin.jar:/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/code/antlr-3.1.1-runtime.jar'
				This is the classpath for specifying several packaged
				dependencies, among other things. This classpath MUST
				include the directory paths to the following five files:
				
					/comtor_data/code/stringtemplate-3.2.jar
					/comtor_data/code/comtor.jar
					/comtor_data/code/antlr-3.1.1.jar
					/comtor_data/code/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6-bin.jar
					/comtor_data/code/antlr-3.1.1-runtime.jar

			JAVA_CONFIG=/mywebsite/comtor/comtor_data/config/java.properties
				This is the directory path to the java.properties file
				that you edited above. It should always be found in the
				comtor_data/config/ directory.
				
			alias java='/usr/bin/java'
			alias javac='/usr/bin/javac'
			alias javadoc='/usr/bin/javadoc'
			alias jar='/usr/bin/jar'
			alias chmod='/bin/chmod'
			alias mkdir='/bin/mkdir'
			alias mv='/bin/mv'
			alias rm='/bin/rm'
			alias find='/usr/bin/find'
			alias cat='/bin/cat'
			alias grep='/bin/grep'
				These are the paths to all of these commands. Please enter
				the paths as they correspond on your system.
				
4. 	You will have to ensure you have the correct permission on certain directories
	and files so that COMTOR can write to them.
	
	Please navigate to the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX directory, and run the following commands:
		XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx
		XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX TO BE DONE
		
5.	You will have to make a cronjob for the email notifications.
	To do so, enter the following command into XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
		XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX TO BE DONE
		
6.	You will have to compile the source code.
	To do so, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
		PACKAGER.SH SHOULD DO THIS ULTIMATELY, SO THIS STEP WILL BE TAKEN OUT.
