Comment Mentor Developer README File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Summary]

 This document describes the coding guidelines for developing COMTOR's
 core and its tools, outlines the overall architecture, and lists some
 of the infrastructure available in the codebase so you can avoid
 re-inventing the wheel. Hints on where to start reading the code are
 given as a list of core interfaces you should read. Of course, we
 strive to make our comments as informative and "non-stale" as possible.
 If you find a discrepancy between the code and a comment, fix the comment
 or the code.

[Development Environment]

 Feel free to use Netbeans, pico, notepad, emacs, vi, or whatever your
 editor or IDE of choice is. The only real restrictions are that we
 have an Ant build script available and we recommend developing with
 the JDK 5.x.

[Coding Guidelines]

 return types a line above method name
 document each parameter as IN or OUT, R, W, or RW
 separate ++ and -- from statements
 document short-circuits
 use a begin brace on a new line (not K&R style, not GNU style)
 no tabs -- three spaces for new code scope indentation
 no whitespace at end of line
 make code compact (no extraneous empty lines)
 declare variables at beginning of scope
 use default constructor, set properties, then initialize() or execute()
 provide sensible default non-implemented behavior for different cases
  and else{}'s...not silent failure
 prefer return values to Exceptions
