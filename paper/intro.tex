\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Comments, no way to rate them, manual & subjective process. Large task and
load on TA and professor. Lack of good comment writing until apprenticeship
in a software engineering effort (industry of academic). Comments seen as a
burden rather than a tool -- hard to gauge effectivness of a comment, hard
to rate the quality of a comment, even for oneself, even though one may
think that a comment is fairly high quality ``wow that's a good comment'',
but the true test is when someone goes back and uses that comment a week or
a month later.
