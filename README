[Executive Summary]

Comment Mentor is a tool for automatically assessing the quality of source
code comments. It currently works on JavaDoc-style comments for Java code.
It is built with the Apache Ant tool and is known to work with the JDK 5.x.
Comment Mentor measures a number of features of source code comments and
rates the features of your code against standard code bases that have been
evaluated by hand. A summary and detailed report of how your comments stack
up against this test suite is generated.
