COMMENT AVG RATIO

This document descibes the method used in the CommentAvgRatio.java doclet used by COMTOR.

Comment Average Ratio counts up the number of words in each comment of class and each
method, and reports this to the user. The doclet then calculates the average length of
of all the comments within a given class, and reports this to the user.

The report is organized into a section for each class. Each class is given a 'classID',
which is based off of the number of the counter as a for loop parses through the list
of classes. For example, the counter in the for loop will increment each time a class
is parsed through. Based on the current counter, a three digit number (such as '001, or
'002') is formed to create the section for that class. Similarly, methods are assigned
a 'methodID' in the same way. Therefore, the order that classes and methods are returned
in the report is based on the order in which they are parsed, which is based on the order
in which they are listed by javadoc.

Comment Average Ratio simply parses through all of the classes and methods, using
getRawCommentText() to pull out the text of the comments, and uses a scanner to count the
number of words.
