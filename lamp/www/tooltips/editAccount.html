<h3>Editing Your Account Settings</h3>
<p>This page allows you to modified three characteristics about your COMTOR account:

<ol>
<li>Changing your password: the <b>Change Password</b> link takes you to the Change Password form 
allowing you to change you COMTOM account password.</li>

<li>Disabling your account: the <b>Diable Account</b> link will allow you to disable your account so
that it is no longer active in the system. Be sure this is what you wish to do, as once you 
confirm your action, there's no going back!</li>

<li>Update your profile: the two fields present on this screen (<b>Name</b> and <b>School</b>)
allow you to modify your COMTOR account profile to correct spelling errors in your name, or to
correct a mis-entered school name. Be sure you are selecting the school which you attend, as this
information is tied to the available course list, and you can not enroll in a course which is not
offered at your school.</li>
