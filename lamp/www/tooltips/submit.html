<h3>Submitting Your Code</h3>
<p>There are two steps involved in order to submit your assignment to dropbox:</p>
<ul>
<li>First choose the jar file that you want to submit from the <b>Choose File</b> selection. COMTOR
currently only accepts Java jar files so please ignore the other options on the right menu.
<b>Java Source Jar</b> is the default menu item, and the only one currently supported.<br/></li>

<li>Next, you must select the required assignment from the assignment pulldown menu. Once you
have chosen an assignment, the checkmarks for the modules will be grayed out because the Instructor
may only want certain modules for certain assignments. It is there to indicate to the student which
one  COMTOR is going use for that assignment. At this time COMTOR may only be accessed through
the dropbox through the Instructor's assignments and is not open to free choice of which modules to
use.</li>

<p>Once the file and assignment have been chosen click on <b>Analyze Comments</b>and you will
see the results of the analysis for that assignment. If you upload the wrong .jar file, you
can <b>Reset</b> the form and select again.
