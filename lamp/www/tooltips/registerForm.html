<h3>Registering an Account</h3>

<p>In order to use COMTOR you need to register an account. You will need to provide your name, institution, and email address.  TCNJ students using the system should use their <b><tt>@tcnj.edu</tt></b> email address to be sure we correctly track you use for extra credit.</p>

<p>Your instructor (or the system administrator) may use the system to email you. Additionally, the system can send automatic emails regarding new COMTOR assignments (dropboxes for source code for labs, projects). Finally, you can recover your password via email, so a valid email address is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>After all of the required information has been submitted, click on the <b>Register</b> button and a temporary password will be sent to you (via email).</p>

<p>Once you have received the email message, return to the COMTOR web site (www.comtor.org) and select the <b>Login</b> menu item to login. You will need to provide your email address and the temporary password assigned to you. You will be able to change your password later under the <b>Account Management</b> menu item.</p>
